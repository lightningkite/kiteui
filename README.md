# KiteUI

A Kotlin Multiplatform UI Framework inspired by Solid.js.

## Goals

- Small JS size
- Web Client and server-side rendering, Android, iOS, eventually desktop
- Pretty by default - ugliness should take effort
- Simple Routing
- Easy to extend into native components on the platform
- Make loading and issue handling pretty without manual work

## Interesting design decisions

- Base navigation around URLs to be very compatible with web
- Use themes for styling; avoid direct styling.
- Derive theme variants from existing themes.  Make theme variants semantically based.
- Don't use kotlinx.coroutines, it's too big - include a custom, simpler, and more limited implementation
- Don't use a KMP network client, they're all too big - include a custom, simpler, and more limited implementation

## Project Status

Early in development.  Web is basically usable at this point, but everything is subject to change.

### TO DO:

- [ ] Some kind of simple validation system
- [ ] Server-side rendering

## Take a look!

You can look at the [example project we're hosting](https://kiteui.cs.lightningkite.com/) to get an idea of what you can do.

If you want to try another theme, start [here](https://kiteui.cs.lightningkite.com/), change the theme, then go to the "Sample Log In" sreen.
